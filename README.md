# xv6-system-practice

We'll be doing kernel hacking projects in xv6, a port of a classic version of Unix to a modern processor, Intel's x86. It is a clean and small kernel.

This first project is intended to be a warmup, and thus relatively light. You will not write many lines of code for this project. Instead, a lot of your time will be spent learning where different routines are located in the existing source code. 

## The objectives of this project are:

1.Gain comfort looking through more substantial code bases written by others in which you do not need to understand every line

2.Obtain familiarity with the xv6 code base in particular

3.Learn how to add a system call to xv6 

4.Add a user-level application that can be used within xv6

5.Become familiar with a few of the data structures in xv6 (e.g., process table)

6.Use the gdb debugger on xv6
